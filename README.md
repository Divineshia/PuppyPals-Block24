# PuppyPals-Block24
In this workshop, we will learn the basics of manipulating data in React. So far, we have used React via a CDN. But from now on, we will use npm

Note: Make sure that you have Node.js

Be aware that these projects will use a few more files than we have used before. But, do not worry. All the complicated setup has already been done. And, we need to work in only one directory.

The React documentation
